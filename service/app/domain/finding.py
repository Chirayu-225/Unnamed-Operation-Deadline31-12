"""
Finding — the canonical, unified representation of "something the
evaluator discovered," as distinct from CheckResult ("what the
evaluator did"). Before this module, the codebase had three separate
species of "something went wrong" — CheckResult (deterministic),
SemanticFlag (single-table semantic), and CrossTableSemanticFinding
(cross-table semantic) — each with a different shape, which meant the
scorer had to understand each species individually.

This is deliberately an ADDITIVE refactor, not a replacement:
CheckResult, ScanResult, SemanticFlag, VerifiedFlag, and
CrossTableSemanticFinding all keep their existing fields untouched, so
the public API response shape and the frontend are unaffected. Finding
is built via converters from those existing types, consumed
internally by the scorer, and available for future evidence/UI work.

Design decisions locked in before implementation (see conversation):
- `category` reuses MetricCategory — no new taxonomy.
- `check_type` is a separate axis from `category`: which layer
  produced this, not which quality dimension it affects.
- `severity` is DERIVED, not independently assigned by every check —
  from field criticality (nullable) for deterministic findings, and
  from confidence + verification_status for semantic findings. It is
  informational/display-only in this pass; the scorer computes its
  own numeric weight from the same underlying source facts, not by
  reversing severity back into a number, so scoring behavior is
  provably unchanged (see app/scoring/scorer.py).
- `verification_status` is a first-class field (not buried in
  metadata), since scorer.py already branches on it directly.
- Finding identity is a DETERMINISTIC hash, not a random UUID — so a
  before/after regression diff (same dataset, same code path, run
  twice) produces identical Finding IDs, which is what makes "did the
  refactor change behavior" provable rather than asserted.
- REJECTED semantic/cross-table flags never become a Finding at all —
  same exclusion the pre-refactor code already applied before
  building flagged_row_indices; the converter just does it up front.
