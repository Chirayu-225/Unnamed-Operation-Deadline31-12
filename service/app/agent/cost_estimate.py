"""
Pre-scan cost/coverage estimate — shown to the user BEFORE they commit
to running a scan, rather than surprising them with the actual LLM
call count after the fact. Pure arithmetic over the same batching math
GeneratorAgent._run_semantic_with_iteration already uses (full-table
coverage by default, `_DEFAULT_PRODUCTION_SAMPLE_SIZE` rows per call,
capped by an optional `max_llm_calls`) — this module runs NO LLM
calls itself and doesn't need API keys configured to produce an
estimate.

Deliberately conservative about what it claims to know:
- Verifier calls are NOT included in the estimate. How many rows the
  generator flags — and therefore how many verification calls that
  requires — is exactly what running the scan determines; estimating
  it beforehand would mean guessing the scan's own outcome. The
  returned estimate says so explicitly rather than silently omitting
  it.
- The dollar figure is illustrative, not authoritative. Real
  per-token pricing varies by provider, model, and changes over time;
  hardcoding a rate that goes stale would be worse than not giving a
  number, so `_ILLUSTRATIVE_COST_PER_1K_TOKENS` is clearly labeled as
  a rough placeholder in both the code and the response, not fetched
  from any live pricing source.
