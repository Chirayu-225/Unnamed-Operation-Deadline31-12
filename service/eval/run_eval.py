"""
Agentic evaluation harness — runs the real GeneratorAgent pipeline
against the forged datasets in eval/datasets/ and scores it against
their known ground truth, instead of eyeballing demo output.

Three things this measures, per the scope agreed for this pass:

1. DETECTION ACCURACY — precision/recall/F1 of flagged_row_indices
   against each dataset's planted issues, split into "deterministic"
   (checks alone should catch these) and "semantic-only" (nothing but
   the LLM layer can catch these) so a weak semantic layer can't hide
   behind strong deterministic coverage.

2. ITERATION-LOOP BEHAVIOR UNDER REAL LOAD — these tables are 143-150
   rows, well past the sample size (20), so unlike the unit tests
   (which use tiny tables and fake LLMs to force specific iteration
   counts), this reports what the loop ACTUALLY does against a real
   model on realistically-sized, realistically-messy data:
   semantic_iterations per run, and whether multiple cycles actually
   surfaced additional true positives or just spent extra calls.

3. CUSTOM-INSTRUCTION RELIABILITY — a small battery of plain-English
   instructions per dataset, run through RuleCompiler directly (cheap:
   one LLM call each, no full scan needed to judge classification
   accuracy), checked against a hand-labeled expected kind
   (structured / semantic / should-fail-on-hallucinated-field).

Two runtime modes:
  - No GROQ_API_KEY / GEMINI_API_KEY set: only section 1's
    DETERMINISTIC-ONLY baseline runs (no LLM calls needed for that —
    it's pure Check execution). Sections needing the LLM print a clear
    "skipped — set API keys" notice and are left out of the report
    rather than silently reporting zeros.
  - Both keys set: the full three-section eval runs for real, against
    real Groq + Gemini calls. This costs real API usage — small
    (roughly a dozen calls total across 3 datasets) but not free.

Run from service/, with keys set if you want the full eval:
